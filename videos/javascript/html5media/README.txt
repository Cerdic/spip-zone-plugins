HTML5 video for everyone!
=========================

HTML5 video tags make embedding videos into documents as easy as embedding an
image. All it takes is a single <video> tag. Unfortunately, not all browsers
natively support HTML5 video tags.


Enabling video tags in all major browsers
-----------------------------------------

To enable HTML5 video tags in all major browsers, simply paste the following
code into the <head> of your document:

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/path/to/your/jquery.html5media.min.js"></script>
    
This will allow you to embed videos into your document using the following easy syntax:

    <video src="video.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls autobuffer></video>

Help! My video won't play!
--------------------------

It's probably encoded incorrectly. Videos should always be saved as h.264 (mp4),
or Theora (ogv) files. Find out more on our Video Formats page:

What's in the box?
------------------

The html5media project consists of a single, minified Javascript file that is
used to detect your browser's HTML5 video capabilities. Any video tags than
cannot be played are dynamically replaced with a Flash video player.

The bundled Flash video player is provided by Flowplayer under the GPL3 licence.
Find out more about Flowplayer at their website:

    * http://flowplayer.org
    
If you keep all the html5media files in the same folder, and it should all work
just fine. If you move the flowplayer.swf and flowplayer.controls.swf files to
another location, then you'll need to tell html5media where they are using the
following javascript commands:

    $.html5media.flowplayerSwf = "/path/to/your/flowplayer.swf";
    $.html5media.flowplayerControlsSwf = "/path/to/your/flowplayer.controls.swf";
