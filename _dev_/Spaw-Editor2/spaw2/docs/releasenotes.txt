2.0.4 Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

This release fixes some outstanding issues like undo/redo functionality in IE, 
CSS classes for table cells, plus many more. It also adds and updates a couple
of language files for bothe core and Spaw File Manager plugin. A couple of new
features were added too.

These are only a few of the many changes in the 2.0.4 release. For a complete
list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes some language files that were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
