In case you use the tool "Curly inverted commas" << French double quotes >> of the plug-in Swiss Knife, then pgn4spip must be enabled AFTER Swiss Knife.

________________

1. Setup of the plug-in

As all plugins once you have first created:
- a folder plugins/auto/
- a folder lib/

The pgn4web folder has a size of 13 MB.
In the case of site having a limited hard disk,
one can eventually delete certain unused fonts 
among alpha, merida, svgchess or demo files.
Keep at least the fonts uscf/20 and 26.

Test02 MultiPgn.txt    : several chess games
Test03 Puzzle Fen.txt  : two chess problems
Test04 Puzzle URL      : chess problems through the URL of .pgn file
Test05 Puzzle Doc.txt  : chess problems in .pgn file attached to the article
Test06 Comment.txt     : comments in a chess game

3.1 Troubleshooting

Symptom 1: with Swiss Knife enabled
Instead of the chessboard, I see the header of the PGN with eventually
some strange quotes or even chess figurines inside PGN comments.

Solution 1: disable pgn4spip then reenable pgn4spip.
This allows pgn4spip to be enabled after Swiss Knife.

Solution 2: if the problem persists, try again emptying the SPIP cache
between disabling and reenabling the pgn4spip plugin.
SPIP 3 : Maintenance > Empty the cache > Click "Empty the cache" in Current cache size

Solution 3: if the problem persists, try again emptying equally the browser cache otherwise
disable Swiss Knife or its tool "Curly inverted commas".
__________

Symptom 2: parameters inside tag <pgn> of attached document are not taken in consideration
Wrong syntax: <pgn1 | movesDisplay = puzzle bd = s>

Solution: add option="..." and remove each blank separator 
except after a value and the next parameter.
<pgn1|option="movesDisplay=puzzle bd=s sS=35">

See test\Test05

3.2 Live broadcast of the chess game

test\Test09 and test10 show the usage of parameters movesDisplay=live and refreshMinutes=0.25
that manage the periodic refresh of the chessboard from file
pgnData=http://localhost/spip/plugins/pgn4spip/pgn4web/live/live.pgn
updated at a different frequency using the simulator
spip\plugins\pgn4spip\pgn4web\live\live-simulation.sh

This is an Unix Bash script that can be run in Windows with the freeware c:\cygwin
Read instructions in test\Test09

spip\plugins\pgn4spip\test\MacroRunSimu.bat is a batch tool to be customized.
Indicate the full path of your web server and the folder of the plugin.
It defines doskey macros for the command line "Command Prompt" in Windows
to launch your web server and the (s)imulateur.
