Tilburg live is a simulation of 2 games played in accelerated time.

Requirements in Windows Vista or more:
live.pgn simulator in the unix shell bash freely supplied by Cygwin.

If necessary, stop temporarily the firewall before downloading the setup.
Download and run [Cygwin Setup.exe->http://cygwin.com/index.html] in two steps:
- download Cygwin packages (bash is included by default) from one of .edu site in your hard disk for example in d:\Tools\Cygwin\
- restart setup.exe and install in c:\cygwin

Edit Test\MacroRunSimu.bat in order to adapt the paths of your Web server and SPIP plugin:
<cadre>
@echo off
REM Define doskey macros to start/stop the web server or the simulator of live broadcast
title Xampp Apache server
REM Adapt the path of the Web server
set PATH_WEB_SERVER=D:\Tools\Internet\Php\Xampp\Xampp177
REM Adapt if necessary the path of the SPIP plugin in particular if there is not htdocs
set PATH_SPIP_WINDOWS=%PATH_WEB_SERVER%\htdocs\spip\plugins\pgn4spip
REM Adapt if necessary the path of cygwin binaries. By default it is installed in:
set PATH_CYGWIN=c:\cygwin\bin
</cadre>

In a Windows command prompt (from All Programs > Accessories), run MacroRunSimu.bat
<cadre>
Web server: st(a)rt st(o)p (s)imu (h)elp (e)xit
</cadre>
This creates the doskey macro (<b>s)</b>imulation.

Before

[pgn movesDisplay=live squareSize=30 extendedOptions=true
pgnData=http://localhost/spip/plugins/pgn4spip/pgn4web/live/live.pgn refreshMinutes=0.25]
[/pgn]

After
- If a8 is blinking, start the simulation (see below) and reload the page by F5 key.

- If the full live.pgn already exists, you can accelerate the moves clicking several times h6 square.

In the Windows Command Prompt, enter the doskey macro command "s". Validate by ENTER.

done with games... waiting for a while before deleting live.pgn
</cadre>

When "live broacast ended, click H6 for the next event" appears under the chessboard,
select with the mouse the Command Prompt to give it the focus.

Press Ctrl+C to stop the bash script as rewritten in the title of the Command Prompt window.

This close the Command Prompt window.
You can restart the simulation by the doskey macro "s"
because live.pgn will be deleted and created again.
----
An alternative to produce in real-time live.pgn is [Arena->http://www.playwitharena.com/] 3.0:
- Menu "Options" > "Appearance..." > PGN > [x] {{Save}} current game {{after every move}} for example in another location:
<cadre>
D:\Tools\Internet\Php\Xampp\Xampp177\htdocs\spip\IMG\pgn\live.pgn
</cadre>
- Menu "Engine" > "Tournament" > Settings: organize a duel between two chess engines.

However the chess engines require almost 100% of CPU during all the game. This is not the case of Cygwin bash.
